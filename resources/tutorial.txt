Welcome to the tutorial!

Omvex is a program that generates synthetic images.
You need to have backgrounds and 3D models.

Omvex has two modes. First one is CameraCalibration, second is Viewport.
You can switch between them in the menubar [Mode].

Firstly, we want to configure the camera and get parameters.
Switch mode to [CameraCalibration] if it isn't already.

------------------------
CAMERA CALIBRATION
------------------------
In the right window, you see loaded backgrounds.
You can add a background with [Open image] or add preconfigured parameters with [Open params].

Once you add a background, a few options will appear.
On the main view, you need to set a planar surface (rectangle) that matches the 3D view.
On the right window, you then set the dimensions of the planar surface along the x and y axes (units [cm]).
You can also view and set grid points along both axes.
Once you are happy with the configuration, you can save the parameters.
Parameters will be saved in the same folder as the background image with the same name but a .json extension.
You can configure multiple backgrounds and save them all.

Now that you have cameras calibrated, you can switch to [Viewport] mode.

------------------------
VIEWPORT
------------------------
On the right, you can load cameras that you configured (.json) and also 3D models (.obj).
Now that you have all cameras and models in the scene, you need to set a couple of options.
First is the dimming effect on cameras, and second is the spawning area where models will be placed.
You can also change the resolution in the menubar [Settings] -> [Resolution] and test simulation of models with button [Simulate].
Then you set the number of images you want to render, click [Start Render], and select a folder.
